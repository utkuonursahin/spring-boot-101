# Spring Boot Web Server with MySQL
This is a simple Spring Boot Web Server with MySQL. It is a simple CRUD application with a single table. The table is called `customer` and it has the following columns: `id`, `name`, `email`. The application is built using Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, Spring Web, MySQL.

This is my very first Spring Boot application. I have created this application to learn Spring Boot and I'll be working on Spring Boot more.
